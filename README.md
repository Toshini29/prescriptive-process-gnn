# SEPSIS CASE: Prescriptive Process Monitoring with Graph Neural Networks

Bachelor thesis implementation — Information Systems, TUM.

A framework for semantically explainable prescriptive process decision support. Process cases are represented as semantically enriched Process Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) and a Graph Attention Network is trained on those graphs using outcome-quality-weighted supervision. Recommendations are accompanied by three-level explanations: gradient-based feature attribution (Integrated Gradients), subgraph-based structural attribution (GNNExplainer), and a human-readable clinical narrative.

Instantiated and evaluated on a real-world sepsis patient event log.

## Data

The event log (`Sepsis Cases - Event Log.xes`) is a real-world sepsis patient dataset from a Dutch hospital. It is not included in this repository due to data use restrictions. The dataset is publicly available at the [4TU Research Data repository](https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/Sepsis_Cases_-_Event_Log/12707639).

Place the file at `data/logs/Sepsis Cases - Event Log.xes` before running the pipeline.

## KARIBDIS Attribution

The files in `karibdis/` are adapted from the [KARIBDIS framework](https://github.com/INSM-TUM/karibdis) developed at the Information Systems group, Technical University of Munich. KARIBDIS constructs semantically enriched Process Knowledge Graphs from event logs using ontological alignment and SHACL-based deduction. It serves as both the PKG construction infrastructure and the rule-based evaluation baseline in this work.
